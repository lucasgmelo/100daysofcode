          Now, I'm listening Taylor Swift's new album.
          Evermore. Willow is my favourite one. Today I was thinking about smash
          hits. And Taylor has a lot od smash hits. Such a good singer.

          Still thinking about smash hits. Katy Perry is
          another singer w/ a lot of smash hits. I love her. Her new album is
          simply perfect. Coding makes me wanna Smile. I think I should make
          this whole page about smash hits. Ok, I'll do it.

        <h2>gurl, that's so simple to understand.</h2>
        <p>
          a smash hit is like a HUUUUUUGE hit. like thinking in Fergie and think
          about Big Girls don't cry. Cardi B and WAP. Despacito. See you again.
        </p>
        <h3>from popular dictionary:</h3>
        <p>a popular and successful song, play, or movie:</p>
        <h3>my opinion:</h3>
        <p>
          some artist don't have a smash hit. like ariana grande. ok she has
          such gooood songs. but I don't think there's one that you think about
          her instantly. not like thinking about PSY and Gangnam Style.
        </p>
        <p>
          to finish, a smash hit doesn't have to be the most popular thing in
          the world. Big girls don't cry by Fergie is not a song that EVERYONE
          know. but is still her smash hit. just like Fergalicious.
