# 100 days of code

<p>This Challenge is about to code, at least, one hour every day for the next 100 days.</p>
<p>I also decided to do this in my own way: I can study a subject related to development any day. For me, being a good developer isn't just about code :)</p>
<p>I'm writing on Notion all important points.</p>

## what I did each day: 

### day 1: review all most important HTML tags / create a simple landing page with html
### day 2: SEO - Search Engine Optimization
### day 3: learn about web accessibility
### day 4: CSS introdution + seletors / style the page landing with basic tools
