# 100 days of code

This Challenge is about to code, at least, one hour every day for the next 100 days :)
I also decided to do this in my own way: I can study a subject related to development any day. For me, being a good developer isn't just about code :)

### day 1: review all most important HTML tags
### day 2: SEO - Search Engine Optimization
### day 3: learn about web accessibility
