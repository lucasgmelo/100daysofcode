<h1>100 days of code</h1> 100 days of code

<p>This Challenge is about to code, at least, one hour every day for the next 100 days.</p>
<p>I also decided to do this in my own way: I can study a subject related to development any day. Some people prefer to do mini projects everyday, but I'm trying to study a topic and apply in code when it's neccessary.</p>
<p>I'm just someone trying to learn a bit more everyday </p>
<p> ps: the days that there's no project, it's because I'm just studying. I'm writing on Notion all important points.</p>

<h2>what I did each day: </h2> 

<h3 id="day1"> day 1: review all most important HTML tags </h3>
<p>I've created a simple landing page, just with HTML, to review all tags</p>

<h3 id="day2"> day 2: SEO - Search Engine Optimization </h3>
<p>Here, I understood what SEO really means. How is so important to pay attention on it when you're developing a website. </p>

<h3 id="day3"> day 3: web accessibility </h3>
<p>Today, I've studied how web accessibility is importante on web development. Not only that, but I tried to put myself in that situation to really understand how voice assistance tools (and others) work.</p>

<h3 id="day4"> day 4: CSS introdution + seletors </h3>
<p>I've made a review of all CSS concepts and seletors (like, ~, bigger than, +). I also stylized the landing page from day 1 . It's so simple, but it was just to apply what I was studying. </p>

<h3 id="day5"> day 5: flexbox </h3>
<p>Today, I've searched how Flexbox works and played a really nice game to review everything: Flexbox Froggy. I've already used it to style the last landing page.</p>

<p>I'm also working in another project called Dogs you can check here: https://github.com/lucasgmelo/dogs </p>
